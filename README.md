Current Game is just a placeholder for me to learn basics.

Idle Inflation RPG will be based on the hit game Inflation RPG.

It will take core elements, items and progression from the Original Game.
The focus is to turn it into more of an idler with more QoL and Automation.

Autostatting, auto setting, auto restart and run farming

Items will be partly split up into materials to give more enemies and areas purpose, as well as help balance the progression.
And will also be balanced in a more sensical way.

The map layout will be the same and can be navigated by clicking different zones.
In there you can auto battle for 1, x or endless turns.
Boss will require more active play until later items for automation and respawnability

Item slots:
Weapon Slot, Armor Slot, Character Slot?, Accessory Slots are upgradeable and unlockable to hold more and better items.
